# About me
I'm 25 years old and currently i'm living in Moscow. I studied philosophy in HSE Moscow and researched totalitarian societies. I have not finished my university course yet, but i'm going to defend my thesis next year. As my final project I decided to explore the image of Russian revolutionary in books of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky.

Now i'm working as support agent in Tutu.ru. My job is to help our customers when they encounter some issues while using our product. Before that I've been working in Apple firstly as Support Engeener than as Chief Support Engeener. In Apple I helped customers to resolve their issues as well and communicated with developers about critical issues.

I'm very interested in Computer Science. I've been learning Frontend technologies for a while.
